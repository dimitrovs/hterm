## hterm - simple terminal

hterm is a simple terminal emulator for X which sucks less.
This version includes a trackpad navigation feature and a trackpad-based text selection mode.

## Features

### Trackpad Navigation

This terminal includes a feature to control the cursor and shell history
using the trackpad.

- **How it works:** When the terminal window is in focus, the mouse
  pointer will disappear, and trackpad movements will be translated
  into arrow key presses. This allows for keyboard-free cursor
  movement and history navigation.
- **Configuration:** The feature can be configured at compile-time by
  editing the `config.def.h` file. The following options are available:
  - `trackpadRemap`: (0 or 1) Enable or disable the feature.
  - `trackpadThresholdX`, `trackpadThresholdY`: Sensitivity for movement.
  - `trackpadInvertX`, `trackpadInvertY`: Invert movement direction.

### Trackpad Text Selection Mode

Select text using the trackpad without holding mouse buttons.

- Enter selection mode: Click once on the trackpad (left click) inside the terminal.
- Extend selection: Move the trackpad; the selection grows left/right and up/down as you move.
- Exit selection mode: Click once again. The mode is exited and the selected text remains highlighted.
- Notes:
  - Copy/Paste actions are provided separately via a menu and are not triggered automatically when exiting selection mode.
  - Word/line snapping still works on the initial click based on double/triple-click timing.

## Requirements

In order to build hterm you need the Xlib header files.

## Installation

Edit config.mk to match your local setup (hterm is installed into
the /usr/local namespace by default).

Afterwards enter the following command to build and install hterm (if
necessary as root):

    make clean install

## Running hterm

If you did not install hterm with make clean install, you must compile
the st terminfo entry with the following command:
