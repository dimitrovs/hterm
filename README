hterm - simple terminal
--------------------
hterm is a simple terminal emulator for X which sucks less.
This version includes a trackpad navigation feature.

Features
--------
### Trackpad Navigation
This terminal includes a feature to control the cursor and shell history
using the trackpad.

- **How it works:** When the terminal window is in focus, the mouse
  pointer will disappear, and trackpad movements will be translated
  into arrow key presses. This allows for keyboard-free cursor
  movement and history navigation.
- **Configuration:** The feature can be configured at compile-time by
  editing the `config.def.h` file. The following options are available:
  - `trackpadRemap`: (0 or 1) Enable or disable the feature.
  - `trackpadThresholdX`, `trackpadThresholdY`: Sensitivity for movement.
  - `trackpadInvertX`, `trackpadInvertY`: Invert movement direction.

### Text Selection Mode
A special text selection mode is available to make it easier to select text with the trackpad.

- **How it works:**
  - A single click on the trackpad (left mouse button) enters text selection mode.
  - As you move the trackpad, text is selected.
  - A second click exits text selection mode, leaving the text selected.
- **Configuration:** This feature can be enabled or disabled at compile-time by editing the `config.def.h` file.
  - `text_select_mode`: (0 or 1) Enable or disable the feature.

necessary as root):
