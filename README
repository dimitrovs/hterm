hterm - simple terminal
--------------------
hterm is a simple terminal emulator for X which sucks less.
This version includes a trackpad navigation feature.

Features
--------
### Trackpad Navigation
This terminal includes a feature to control the cursor and shell history
using the trackpad.

- **How it works:** When the terminal window is in focus, the mouse
  pointer will disappear, and trackpad movements will be translated
  into arrow key presses. This allows for keyboard-free cursor
  movement and history navigation.
- **Configuration:** The feature can be configured at compile-time by
  editing the `config.def.h` file. The following options are available:
  - `trackpadRemap`: (0 or 1) Enable or disable the feature.
  - `trackpadThresholdX`, `trackpadThresholdY`: Sensitivity for movement.
  - `trackpadInvertX`, `trackpadInvertY`: Invert movement direction.

Requirements
------------
In order to build hterm you need the Xlib header files.


Installation
------------
Edit config.mk to match your local setup (hterm is installed into
the /usr/local namespace by default).

Afterwards enter the following command to build and install hterm (if
necessary as root):

    make clean install


Running hterm
-------------
If you did not install hterm with make clean install, you must compile
the st terminfo entry with the following command:

    tic -sx st.info

See the man page for additional details.
